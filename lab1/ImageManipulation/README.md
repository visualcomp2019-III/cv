# Image manipulation Laboratory 1

To run use the `ImageManipulation.pde` file, this will display several buttons with the several requested image manipulations, the different results are displayed bellow:

- Luma gray scale: Click this button to display the image after applying luma gray scale.

- Average gray scale: this displays the image applying the average of every pixel.

- Display Histogram: Displays the histogram form the _luma gray scale_.

- Segmented image from Histogram: This first applies luma gray scale to get the Histogram, then segments the image using the generated histogram. This segmented image is the last shown.

- Edge detection convolution: Applies a convolution kernel in the original image to get an edge detected image:

- Gaussian blur convolution: Applies Gaussian convolution mask to get a blur in the image:

- Unsharp masking convolution:  Applies Unsharp masking convolution mask.
